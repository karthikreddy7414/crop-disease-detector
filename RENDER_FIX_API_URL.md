# üîß Render API Fix - "Failed to fetch" Error

## Problem Found! ‚úÖ

Your Render deployment is **working**, but the frontend was calling the wrong API URL!

### The Issue

In `static/index.html` line 251:
```javascript
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:8000';  // ‚ùå WRONG!
```

This meant:
- Frontend loads from: `https://crop-disease-detector-1.onrender.com`
- But tries to call API at: `http://localhost:8000` ‚ùå
- Result: **"Failed to fetch"** error

### The Fix ‚úÖ

Changed to:
```javascript
const API_BASE = window.location.origin;  // ‚úÖ CORRECT!
```

Now:
- **Locally**: Uses `http://localhost:8000`
- **On Render**: Uses `https://crop-disease-detector-1.onrender.com`
- **Works everywhere!** üéâ

## Additional Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Added response status check
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Shows actual server errors

## Deploy the Fix

### 1. Check What Changed
```bash
git status
```

You should see:
```
Modified:   static/index.html
```

### 2. Commit and Push
```bash
# Add the fix
git add static/index.html

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Use dynamic API URL for Render deployment"

# Push to trigger redeployment
git push origin main
```

### 3. Wait for Render to Redeploy
- Render will automatically detect the push
- Redeployment takes ~2-3 minutes
- Watch the logs in your Render dashboard

### 4. Test Again
1. Go to: `https://crop-disease-detector-1.onrender.com`
2. Upload a crop image (corn, apple, grape, or potato)
3. Select the crop type
4. Click **"Analyze Image"**
5. Should now work! ‚úÖ

## Expected Result

After the fix, you should see:

```
üì∏ Image Analysis Results

Disease Detected: Corn_(maize)___Common_rust_
Confidence: 85.3%
Severity: High
Affected Area: 0.0%
Treatment Recommendation: Disease: Corn_(maize)___Common_rust_...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Errors?

Check Render logs:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for errors during deployment or runtime

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: Mixed content error (HTTP/HTTPS)
- **Solution**: Already fixed! Using `window.location.origin` maintains protocol

**Issue**: CORS error
- **Solution**: Already configured in `src/main.py` to allow all origins

**Issue**: Server timeout
- **Solution**: Free tier may spin down. First request takes ~30 seconds after inactivity

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# Start server
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Open browser
# Go to: http://localhost:8000
# Upload and test image analysis
```

Should work perfectly on localhost now!

## Files Modified

```
‚úÖ static/index.html          (Fixed API_BASE URL)
‚úÖ src/api/routes/image_processing.py  (Previous fix - model loading)
‚úÖ .gitignore                 (Previous fix - track lightweight models)
```

## Summary

| Fix | Status |
|-----|--------|
| Model filename mismatch | ‚úÖ Fixed (previous) |
| API URL hardcoded to localhost | ‚úÖ Fixed (this update) |
| Error handling | ‚úÖ Improved |
| Ready to deploy | ‚úÖ YES! |

## üéâ You're All Set!

Just commit, push, and your Render deployment will work perfectly!

```bash
git add static/index.html
git commit -m "Fix: Use dynamic API URL for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

Then wait 2-3 minutes and test at:
`https://crop-disease-detector-1.onrender.com`

**Your app will be fully functional!** üå±‚ú®
